This project is based on Practicum Data Analytics bootcamp. I have taken the provided data set, and creating a simple, explatory data analysis regarding the dataset. 
We have found different amounts of models, types, and prices of the vehicles shown in the dataset. It was very easy to tell that SUVs, sedans, and trucks are the most popular types of vehicles. Even by personal experience, but I was able to show how many days the car was listed on the lot does not really have an affect on the price of the car. 

You can open this data analysis through a Python3 enviorment. This was created in Anaconda/VS Code with Python programming language applied.
