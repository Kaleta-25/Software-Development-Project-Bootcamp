# Software-Development-Project-Bootcamp
DA Practcium Bootcamp

Introduction : This project is based on Practicum Data Analytics bootcamp. I have taken dataset of car sales advertisements and creating a simple, explatory data analysis. We looked at price, model, model year, and other factors that determined the vehicles.

Conclusion: It was very easy to tell that SUVs, sedans, and trucks are the most popular types of vehicles. Even by personal experience, but I was able to show how many days the car was listed on the lot does not really have an affect on the price of the car. All of the cars are also in great condition. More than 75% of the cars are in excellent or good condition. The most popular paint colors are found to be neutral colors. You csn see purple, orange, and yellow are the least favorite colors. Lastly, the odometer and days listed dont seem to have too much afftect on the price as maoriry of cars are found to be below 50k. 

You can open this data analysis through a Python3 enviorment. This was created in Anaconda/VS Code with Python programming language applied.
